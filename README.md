# Rachio Sample Application:

Rachio has published a public REST api that allows third-party developers to integrate with the Rachio irrigation controller. The documentation for the public api is available on the web at __rachio.readme.io__.

Create an application using Rachio's public API that __allows users to run all a device's zones or specified zones for a set amount of time__.

Use the Rachio test account to obtain an authorization token. The test account username is __rachiobeta__ and the test account password is __test1234__.

Rely on responses from the API to display results and state to the user.
